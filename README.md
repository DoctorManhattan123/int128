# Integer with a length of 128 bit - library for reading and writing

Did you ever use 128 bit integers in C? Probably not, and there is a good reason for it, so don't use them. Thank you!

You are still here? Well, then I have no choice but to explain my library to you.

It is very simple, in the main.c you find an example, in the int128_lib.h you find the headerfile that you can directly include in you project.

Read the documentation in the header, it is pretty seld-explanatory.

I hope this helps you with reading and printing 128 bit integer. If you want to work with 128 bit ineteger in assembler, just write me an Email, I've done that, too.

Star and fork if you used something of this and if you have trouble with 128 bit integer, just create an issue and I might get on it.
