# Int with 128 bit - library for reading and writing

Did you ever use 128 bit integers in C? Probably not, and there is a good reason for it, so don't use them. Thank you!

You still here? Well then I have no choice but to explain my library to you.

It is very simple, in the main.c you find an example, in the int128_lib.h you find the headerfile that you can directly include in you project.

Read the documentation in the header, it is pretty seld-explanatory.

I hope this helps you with reading and printing 128 bit integer. If you want to work with 128 bit ineteger in assembler, just write me an Email, I've done that, too.

Star if you actually used 128 bit integer and write why you needed them, if you want something to be added, just add an issue.
